## Kiwi

Kiwi was created to safeguard users from uncomfortable sexual misconduct or abuse. Built utilizing React.js, this application connects with Google Home to allow the user to say a subtle keyword in tense situations to send an automated message to their emergency contacts. 

We are honored to say that with this application, we placed 1st in HackNY Fall 2018.
