<h1><a id="Kiwi_0"></a>Kiwi</h1>
<p>Kiwi was created to safeguard users from uncomfortable sexual misconduct or abuse. Built utilizing React.js, this application connects with Google Home to allow the user to say a subtle keyword in tense situations to send an automated message to their emergency contacts.</p>
<h1><a id="Intention_3"></a>Intention</h1>
<p>I am driven by the movements that have been happening around the <a href="http://world.My">world.My</a> team thought that it would be appropriate to build something that would help women feel safe in their own homes.</p>
<h3><a id="The_Approach_7"></a>The Approach</h3>
<p>Kiwi is a web application for your Google Home device that allows a user to call a discreet action through their Home speaker and send a distress message to emergency contacts. It listens for a programmable keyword used in any context (in this case “Kiwi”) and triggers a customizable text message to be sent to multiple friends’ or family’s phone numbers. An easy-to-use web interface works alongside the Home device for users to set up an account and input their emergency contacts and messages.</p>
